"""Music/speech discriminator for recurring cue candidates (issue #350).

A common spoken phrase repeats within an episode like an ad-break sting, so the
fingerprint recurrence scan suggests it. It reads as speech, though: its energy
sits in the formant band, it is not tonal, and it is gappy (pauses between
words). A produced sting -- even a bass jingle with a voiceover, like the
measured WSJ content-transition cue (band ratio 0.32, flatness 0.0003, sustained
0.90) -- is tonal and/or sustained with energy outside the band.

So we drop a recurring candidate only when ALL three speech-like conditions hold,
which keeps musical cues. This is applied to WITHIN-episode recurring candidates
only; cross-episode intro/outro candidates (often legitimately spoken) are exempt.

numpy + scipy.fft only (no librosa). Decode spans with
``cue_features.decode_pcm_window``.
